* **File System Management**: The OS provides a **file system**, which allows for the storage and retrieval of files.

### OS Implementation Considerations
When implementing an OS, several considerations must be taken into account, including:
1. **Kernel Design**: The **kernel** is the core part of the OS, responsible for managing hardware resources and providing basic services to applications.
2. **Device Drivers**: **Device drivers** are programs that manage the interaction between the OS and hardware devices.
3. **System Calls**: **System calls** are APIs that allow applications to interact with the OS and access hardware resources.
4. **Interrupt Handling**: **Interrupts** are signals from hardware devices that require the attention of the OS.

### Design Principles
Several design principles guide the development of an OS, including:
* **Modularity**: The OS should be divided into **modules**, each with a specific function, to improve **maintainability** and **scalability**.
* **Reusability**: The OS should provide **reusable** components, such as **libraries** and **frameworks**, to reduce development time and improve **efficiency**.

* **Caching**: The use of **caches** to improve **performance** by reducing the number of **disk accesses**.

### Key Concepts
* **Deadlock**: A situation in which two or more processes are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
* **Starvation**: A situation in which a process is unable to access a resource due to other processes holding onto it for an extended period.
* **Synchronization**: The use of **synchronization primitives**, such as **locks** and **semaphores**, to coordinate access to shared resources.

# CPU Scheduling

Process concepts, process scheduling, and inter-process communication

### Process Concepts
# CPU Scheduling
## Introduction to Process Concepts
The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is the primary component of a computer system that executes most instructions. **CPU Scheduling** is the process of managing the order in which processes or threads are executed by the CPU. Understanding process concepts is essential to comprehend CPU scheduling.

## Process Concepts
A **process** is a program in execution, including the current activity, memory, and system resources. It is an independent entity that is scheduled and executed by the operating system.

### Process Characteristics
The following are key characteristics of a process:
* **Process ID (PID)**: a unique identifier assigned to each process
* **Program Counter**: a register that keeps track of the current instruction being executed
* **Memory**: the process's private memory space
* **Open Files**: files that the process has opened for input or output
* **Permissions**: the access rights and privileges of the process

### Process State
A process can be in one of several states:
1. **New**: the process is being created
2. **Ready**: the process is waiting to be executed by the CPU
3. **Running**: the process is currently being executed by the CPU
4. **Waiting**: the process is waiting for an event to occur, such as I/O completion
5. **Zombie**: the process has finished execution but its parent process has not yet acknowledged its termination
6. **Dead**: the process has finished execution and its parent process has acknowledged its termination

### Process Control Block (PCB)
A **Process Control Block (PCB)** is a data structure that contains information about a process, including:
* **Process ID**
* **Process State**
* **Program Counter**
* **Memory**
* **Open Files**
* **Permissions**
The PCB is used by the operating system to manage and schedule processes.

### Process Life Cycle
The process life cycle consists of the following stages:
1. **Process Creation**: a new process is created
2. **Process Execution**: the process is executed by the CPU
3. **Process Termination**: the process finishes execution and is terminated
4. **Process Scheduling**: the process is scheduled for execution by the CPU

### Key Concepts
* **Context Switching**: the process of switching the CPU's context from one process to another
* **Thread**: a lightweight process that shares the same memory space as other threads in the same process
* **Synchronization**: the mechanism of coordinating access to shared resources by multiple processes or threads

## Process State Transitions
The following are the possible state transitions of a process:
* **New -> Ready**: the process is created and becomes ready to be executed
* **Ready -> Running**: the process is selected by the CPU scheduler and starts execution
* **Running -> Waiting**: the process is waiting for an event to occur, such as I/O completion
* **Waiting -> Ready**: the process is notified that the event has occurred and becomes ready to be executed again
* **Running -> Zombie**: the process finishes execution but its parent process has not yet acknowledged its termination
* **Zombie -> Dead**: the parent process acknowledges the termination of the process and it becomes dead

## Summary
In summary, process concepts are essential to understanding CPU scheduling. A process is a program in execution, and it has several characteristics, such as process ID, program counter, and memory. A process can be in one of several states, including new, ready, running, waiting, zombie, and dead. The process control block (PCB) is a data structure that contains information about a process, and it is used by the operating system to manage and schedule processes. The process life cycle consists of process creation, execution, termination, and scheduling. Understanding these concepts is crucial to designing and implementing efficient CPU scheduling algorithms.
